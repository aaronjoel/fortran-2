Fortran for Chemists
====================

Sometimes, when a pet breaks a leg, or a bird falls from a tree, there is only one kind thing to do. The same is certainly true of Fortran.

Yet, for reasons unbeknownst to me -- and everyone with whom I've discussed this -- it is allowed to limp on.

Instead of teaching useful languages to the chemists of tomorrow (even MATLAB would be better), Fortran steps into the ring. It probably trips on the edge and knocks a tooth out, though.
